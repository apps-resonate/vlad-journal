    -   Size (for condominium)
    -   Search bar to search for project name OR reference ID
    -   Min and Max prices are ransackified to avoid issues with ransort.

-   Ransortified sorting of listings
    -   Fixed Unit Status (Availability)
    -   added second sorting by "Recommendations" after availability for SortBy option "Availability" -- this is the actual solution to the story (display featured properties first in marketplace)
