## What I did today


### General

- Daily Stand-up: 

submitted for PR transaction type validation 

### CSV Upload Debugging and investigation:
- Notifications are not created because it is inside a transaction
	> [!warning] 
	> Objects created in transaction (even inside rescue part of transaction) will be rolled back.
- Records in office upload files contains project names/ids that does not exist yet
	> [!success] 
	> Improved error catching for project name detection
- Fixed Commercial Lot creation
- Restricted validation checking of property type and transaction type to `on: :create
- Added Notification to notify if upload is done but with errors.
