## What I did today


### General

- Daily Stand-up: 30m
- updates on [[2023-01-18 (Wednesday)#^request-complete-video|Request Edward for complete steps]] 
	- Issue is not caused by creating a user and logging in.
	- It is caused by approval to do something
       > [!warning] Edward to update the video to show end-to-end steps to replicate the issue
	- Found bug during approval. Check mark not checked after approval
	- Was able to replicate on staging.
	- Was able to determine the cause of the issue: the link being sent is a basic “root_path” link.
	- Fix changed the root_path link to a url generated my email confirmation with token (devise).
- Assisted Abram with his Letter Offer task
