	- Expected: "Get Started" from Email from must open a new tab to go directly to dashboard as a signed-in user. 
	- Issue: The Link goes to the homepage and does not log in the user.
	- Started investigating the issue link to dashboard issue
	- Trying to replicate the issue on staging but I cannot seem to experience it
